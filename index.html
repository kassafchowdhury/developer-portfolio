            <p>Great advise here!! Picking up website development was such a hustle for me. You have summarized all the
                key
                points that I had to pick up as well from scratch, and it was hectic jumping from one place to another.
                That
                wasa great summary. Newbies will really benefit!!

            <p>Wow, what a breeze, cleared almost all of my doubts. One of the biggest doubt I had was to go JS or Java,
                this clears up many things, now I understand that why both of them are important. Thanks a lot, god
                bless</p>
